        This project was developed as a part of my ECE 4225: Hardware/Software Co-Design class where we were tasked to
        design an embedded system that utilizes communication between hardware and software. For this project, the
        Xilinx Basys 3
        FPGA Development board and it's push buttons were utilized as the hardware interface, as well as a VGA Monitor.
        The MicroBlaze
        Softcore processor was used for the software interface, running a C program. Below is the presentation and
        report associated with
        the project.
