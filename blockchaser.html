        This project was developed as a part of my ECE 4225: Hardware/Software Co-Design class where we were tasked to
        design an embedded system that utilizes communication between hardware and software. For this project, the
        Xilinx Basys 3 FPGA Development board and it's push buttons were utilized as the hardware interface, as well as
        a VGA Monitor.
        The MicroBlaze
        Softcore processor was used for the software interface, running a C program. Below is the presentation and
        report associated with
        the project.

        For the design of the project, four push buttons on the Basys 3 board were used as the user inputs. 
        In hardware, the four buttons are used
        to drive a value that is wired to the MicroBlaze softcore processor. It has a C program that reads that value
        and determines which directional button was pressed. Three VGA frame buffers were implemented for each RGB
        color, whose registers get written into by software based on what needs to be drawn on the screen. They are
        wired to a VGA controller in hardware that implements the vertical and horizontal synchronizations of a VGA
        monitor and processes the RGB values to output onto a 640x480 @60Hz VGA monitor. For the actual game design, the
        user’s block remains still at the start of the game and upon a directional button press, the game starts and the
        user’s block will start to move in that direction until a different button is pressed. The goal is to reach the
        white target blocks on the screen to increase the score and reach the score required to win the game. Once that
        score is reached, the game will reset and the user’s block will return to the center of the screen.

        The basic functional decomposition of this design included functions like handling user input, outputting VGA
        graphics, handling the
        game logic, user block movement, and target positions. Once they were clearly defined, they were then analyzed
        to determine
        whether they should be implemented in hardware or software. For instance, the user input handling was
        implemented via hardware (VHDL).
