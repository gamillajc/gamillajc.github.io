        Welcome! My name is Janssen Gamilla and I am a Computer Engineering Student at Saint Louis University. I am pursuing a career in the 
        space of embedded systems, firmware engineering, or software engineering. Below are some of the projects that I have worked on either personally
        or in my courses at school.
